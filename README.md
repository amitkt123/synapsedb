# SynapseDB

> Connect your data at the speed of thought

A distributed search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene, designed to handle complex queries across massive datasets with neural-network-like efficiency.

## 🚀 Vision

Just as synapses enable rapid communication in the brain, SynapseDB enables rapid discovery across your data. This project is built from the ground up to understand distributed search engines deeply.

## 📋 Current Status

**Phase 1: Core Indexing & Search** (In Progress)

- [x] Project initialization
- [x] Maven structure setup
- [x] Git repository initialized
- [ ] Basic Lucene integration
- [ ] Document indexing
- [ ] Simple search functionality
- [ ] Field mapping
- [ ] Index management

- **Apache Lucene**: 9.9.0
- **Build Tool**: Maven 3.x
- **Future**: Spring Boot 3.x (Phase 4)

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher

### Build the Project
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/synapsedb.git
cd synapsedb

# Build all modules
mvn clean install

# Run tests
mvn test
```

### Quick Example (Coming Soon)
```java
// Initialize SynapseDB
SynapseDB db = new SynapseDB("/data/mydb");

// Index a document
Document doc = new Document();
doc.addField("title", "Introduction to Search Engines");
doc.addField("content", "Learn about inverted indices...");
db.getIndexService().index("articles", doc);

// Search
SearchRequest request = new SearchRequest()
    .query(new MatchQuery("title", "search"));
SearchResponse response = db.getSearchService().search("articles", request);
```
